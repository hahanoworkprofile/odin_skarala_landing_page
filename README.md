Oh well, it is an open source CSS library! Yep, a library! It is compact and use a 12-grid system with flexbox. It is pretty simple, suitable for the "backend dudes" who absolutely need to do frontend things. It is just a simple 500 lines CSS you can download and link with your html files then start adding classes and that's it!
